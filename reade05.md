# Heroku
Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps — we're the fastest way to go from idea to URL,
bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

## Heroku with data
Data lies at the heart of any significant app — whether it's customer data or data about the service it provides — an app and its data go hand in hand. Heroku's rich ecosystem of managed data services includes Heroku Postgres, Heroku Redis and Apache Kafka on Heroku.

Developers shouldn't need to discover how to optimally provision a database through trial and error - but instead have immediate access to a scalable, highly available database with rollback - one that supports their apps and development style.
