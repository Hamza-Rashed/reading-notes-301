# Introduction to Database Normalization
Database normalization is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns.  The main idea with this is that a table should be about a specific topic and only supporting topics included. Take a spreadsheet containing the information as an example, where the data contains salespeople and customers serving several purposes:

Identify salespeople in your organization
List all customers your company calls upon to sell a product
Identify which salespeople call on specific customers.
By limiting a table to one purpose you reduce the number of duplicate data contained within your database. This eliminates some issues stemming from database modifications.

To achieve these objectives, we’ll use some established rules. As you apply these rules, new tables are formed. The progression from unruly to optimized passes through several normal forms.

There are three normal forms most databases adhere to using.  As tables satisfy each successive database normalization form, they become less prone to database modification anomalies and more focused toward a sole purpose or topic. Before we move on be sure you understand the [definition of a database table](https://www.essentialsql.com/what-is-a-database-table/).


# Data Duplication and Modification Anomalies
Notice that for each SalesPerson we have listed both the SalesOffice and OfficeNumber. There are duplicate salesperson data. Duplicated information presents two problems:

It increases storage and decrease performance.
It becomes more difficult to maintain data changes.
For example:

Consider if we move the Chicago office to Evanston, IL. To properly reflect this in our table, we need to update the entries for all the SalesPersons currently in Chicago.  Our table is a small example, but you can see if it were larger, that potentially this could involve hundreds of updates
