# What is jQuery?

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation,
event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. 
With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

``` var hiddenBox = $( "#banner-message" );$( "#button-container button" ).on( "click", function( event ) {hiddenBox.show();}); ```

# Event jacascript :

DOM Events are sent to notify code of interesting things that have taken place. Each event is represented by an object which is based on the Event interface, and may have additional custom fields and/or functions used to get additional information about what happened. Events can represent everything from basic user interactions to automated notifications of things happening in the rendering model.

This article offers a list of events that can be sent; some are standard events defined in official specifications, while others are events used internally by specific browsers; for example, Mozilla-specific events are listed so that add-ons can use them to interact with the browser.

# DOM

The DOM is the way Javascript sees its containing pages' data. It is an object that includes how the HTML/XHTML/XML is formatted, as well as the browser state. A DOM element is something like a DIV, HTML, BODY element on a page. You can add classes to all of these using CSS, or interact with them using JS.
