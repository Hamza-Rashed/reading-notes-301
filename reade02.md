What is jQuery?

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation,
event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. 
With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

var hiddenBox = $( "#banner-message" );
$( "#button-container button" ).on( "click", function( event ) {
  hiddenBox.show();
});
